Fujitsu AirConditioner Controller for HomeKit
----------
Flash to an [M5Atom](https://shop.m5stack.com/collections/atom-series/products/atom-lite-esp32-development-kit), and add your Fujitsu AirConditioner (Heatpump) to your HomeKit home. Should work with most other ESP32 kits as well.

Quick start
-----------

* Clone the repository
* Open repository in PlatformIO
* Build and Upload
* Open Serial Monitor
* Enter 'S <HOMEKIT PIN>' to define the HomeKit pairing pin (eg 'S 11122333')
* Enter 'W' to enter WiFi connection details
* Connect the M5Atom to the AirConditioner via the 3-wire interface (see example circuit) or via the com connector on the indoor unit (will need a logic level converter)
* Power-Cycle your air conditioner

Status LED
----------
- Yellow: 
  - Pulsing: WiFi Details Required
  - Flashing: WiFi Connecting
  - Solid: Wifi Connected
- Magenta:
  - Pulsing: Waiting to pair with HomeKit
- Blue:
  - Solid: Update pending send
- Red:
  - Pulsing: Not bound to the indoor unit
- Green: 
  - Solid: Bound to an indoor unit and processing frames

Secondary Mode
--------------

By default the controller binds to the indoor unit as a secondary controller. If you do not have an existing wall remote controller, you will need to edit FujiHeatPump initialisation to bind as a primary controller.

QR Code
-------

You can generate a QR code to scan with Home.app by using the [QR code generator tool](https://github.com/maximkulkin/esp-homekit/tree/master/tools)

```#  python3 gen_qrcode 21 111-22-333 FUJI output.png```

Alternatively, you can use an online QR code generator such as [the-qrcode-generator.com](https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/), just enter the generated setup payload which is printed after you enter your custom pairing pin (eg `X-HM://00KUG4GWTFUJI`)
